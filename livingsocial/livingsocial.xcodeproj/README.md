## Project Description

Build an iOS/Android app that consumes a [json feed](http://sheltered-bastion-2512.herokuapp.com/feed.json). Produce an application that does the following:

1. Provide a list/grid of the summarized content
2. Each row/item should be clickable to some sort of detail view/page/modal for each item. 
3. Provide a mechanism to either filter or search the data that is shown in the list.

Here's what your submission app must include:

1. An app that consumes the above JSON feed and displays the content from the feed in a reasonable manner. It should also gracefully handle failures in the event of an error.
3. An updated README with instructions on setting up your app/any other notes (see below for note about 3rd party libraries)

Your app does not need to:

- Persist any data

Your submission should also include:

- Some sort of tests as part of submission

Your application should be easy to set up and run, and must use platform native code (No PhoneGap, Xamarin, etc.) Feel free to use any 3rd party libraries that you want to use. If you decide to use a 3rd party library, please include rationale for use in the README.

## Evaluation

Evaluation of your submission will be based on the following criteria. Additionally, reviewers will attempt to assess your familiarity with standard libraries. Reviewers will attempt to assess your experience with Android/iOS based on how you've structured your submission.

1. Did your application fulfill the requirements?
1. Did you follow the instructions for submission?
