## Project Description

Build an iOS/Android app that consumes a [json feed](http://warm-eyrie-4354.herokuapp.com/feed.json). Produce an application that displays a list that best displays the relevant data, customizing things as needed to make things fit. (See the sample row in the repo for a mockup, but please feel free to design the app in any way you want.)

Here's what your mobile app must do:
1. Your app must consume the above JSON feed
2. Display the content from the feed in a reasonable manner
3. You must use platform native code (No PhoneGap, Xamarin, etc.)

Your app does not need to:
1. Persist any data

Your application should be easy to set up and run.

## Evaluation

Evaluation of your submission will be based on the following criteria. Additionally, reviewers will attempt to assess your familiarity with standard libraries. Reviewers will attempt to assess your experience with Android/iOS based on how you've structured your submission.

1. Did your application fulfill the basic requirements?
1. Did you follow the instructions for submission?
